# MW3-PatchOps
 Basic MW3 Spec Ops Tool
 
Can Edit on SpecOps survival Waves/Money plus some other stuff
<br> </br>

*Why should I care?*

Atleast money/wave edits were never done before for survival as the offsets are dynamic and allways change every round restart

Also, with this you get directly the source/methode to do it yourself. So in theory you can paste it straight into your tool, atleast give some credit when you do so...
